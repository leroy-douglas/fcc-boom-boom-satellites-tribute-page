        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
			Boom Boom Satellites were a Japanese electronic music duo consisting of guitarist and vocalist Michiyuki Kawashima and bassist and programmer Masayuki Nakano. While their music can be mostly classified as big beat or nu skool breaks with heavy jazz influences, they are famous for the heavy usage of electric guitars in their music, and the final product often has a strong rock or punk influence. They were signed to Sony Music Entertainment Japan, with whom they had released all of their albums in Japan.
